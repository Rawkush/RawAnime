# *RawAnime*
An anime streaming app to watch all the Animes without any interruption or ads for free.
Just download the app and search for favorite anime and enjoy🎉🎉 your time!! 😉😉


## Working 
The app just scrapes the website 'gogoanime' to fetch the animes and few of their details and streams the same on your mobile phone. 😉
